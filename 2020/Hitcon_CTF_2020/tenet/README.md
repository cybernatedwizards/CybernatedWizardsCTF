When we unpack the attachment, we'll be given two files:

```
release/
release/server.rb
release/time_machine
```

In order to start solving the task, we needed to understand what the ``time_machine`` does. We spent quite some time in Ida and Ghidra to determine what is going on, but debugging this in GDB was a pain, due to the forking and ptrace capabilities of the executable. This is why we have rewritten the entire logic of the ``time_machine`` manually in C, which is provided below.

```

We can then compile the code as follows:

```
g++ debugger.cc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-format -Wno-unused-variable -o debugger
```
Then we only need to come up with the shellcode to feed to the newly written debugger binary (replicated the ``time_machine``), but we have the code, so we can perform all kinds of things, like insert additional code for debugging purposes.

At the end of the day, we basically need to perform three things:

1. A random 8-byte value is generated by the debugger and then copied into the debuggee at 0x2170000 address.
2. The instructions are executed forwards one by one until reaching the [exit](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/) syscall. All the instruction pointer addresses are stored into global array, but at most 0xfff instructions is allowed.

  ![Read Syscall](read_syscall.png)

3. At this point our shellcode has been run and the debugger checks if the entire memory contents 0x2170000 - 0x2171000 is zero, meaning the randomly generated value must not be there - our shellcode must have zeroed out this value. We need to store this value somewhere else, we'll see later on where.
4. The entire general purpose registers as well as floating point registers are zeroed-out, so we can't save the random value in there.
5. All the instructions from our shellcode are executed backwards.
6. A check is made if the original random value is at 0x2170000 address.

At this point we've been pretty close to the solution, all we needed to figure out is where to store the randomly generated value. We can't save them anywhere else in memory, because only the segment 0x2170000 - 0x2171000 is writeable and the debugger will check that the entire contents is zero.

![Memory Segments](memory_segments.png)

Also, we can't save them into any general purpose or floating point register, because those are all zeroed out by the debugger. So where can we actually save the random value that we need to preserve. The following registers are all zeroed out:

```c
struct user_fpregs_struct
{
  __uint16_t                cwd;
  __uint16_t                swd;
  __uint16_t                ftw;
  __uint16_t                fop;
  __uint64_t                rip;
  __uint64_t                rdp;
  __uint32_t                mxcsr;
  __uint32_t                mxcr_mask;
  __uint32_t                st_space[32];   /* 8*16 bytes for each FP-reg = 128 bytes */
  __uint32_t                xmm_space[64];  /* 16*16 bytes for each XMM-reg = 256 bytes */
  __uint32_t                padding[24];
};

struct user_regs_struct
{
  unsigned long r15;
  unsigned long r14;
  unsigned long r13;
  unsigned long r12;
  unsigned long rbp;
  unsigned long rbx;
  unsigned long r11;
  unsigned long r10;
  unsigned long r9;
  unsigned long r8;
  unsigned long rax;
  unsigned long rcx;
  unsigned long rdx;
  unsigned long rsi;
  unsigned long rdi;
  unsigned long orig_rax;
  unsigned long rip;
  unsigned long cs;
  unsigned long eflags;
  unsigned long rsp;
  unsigned long ss;
  unsigned long fs_base;
  unsigned long gs_base;
  unsigned long ds;
  unsigned long es;
  unsigned long fs;
  unsigned long gs;
};
```

We can rely on the fact that there are 128-bit XMM0 - XMM15 floating point registers and their counterpart 256-bit YMM0 - YMM15 floating point registers. We can see that the higher 128-bits of the YMM0 - YMM15 registers are not cleared, so we can store the cookie in there. We can basically use the following shellcode:

```asm
[BITS 64]

global _start

_start:
  ; store cookie to MMX
  mov rax, 0x2170000
  movq xmm0, [rax]
  ; ymm0[127:0] -> ymm0[255:128]
  vperm2f128 ymm0, ymm0, ymm0, 0

  ; set the cookie to 0
  xor rbx, rbx

  ; swallow the cookie
  mov rax, 0x2170000
  mov [rax], rbx
  mov rax, 0x2170000

  ; get the cookie
  movq rbx, xmm0

  ; ymm0[255:128] -> ymm0[127:0]
  vperm2f128 ymm0, ymm0, ymm0, 1

  ; break out of loop
  mov rdi, 0x1
  mov rax, 0x3c
  sysenter
```

We can compile it with netwide assembler, but since we only want the actual shellcode we can use the ``-f bin`` option to get only the flat-form binary.

```
# nasm -f bin shell.asm && xxd -p shell
b800001702f30f7e00c4e37d06c0004831dbb800001702488918b8000017
0266480f7ec3c4e37d06c001bf01000000b83c0000000f34
```

Let's now create our own ELF binary file, the one that was outputted by ruby script and modify just the shellcode part. The part from 00001080 onwards is our shellcode above.

Now we can test our implementation of the program with this file and we'll be able to see that we were able to display the flag.

Next we only need to obtain the actual flag from the provided server for which we can use a modified version of the [Gynvael Coldwind](https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/) [pwnbase.py](https://github.com/gynvael/stream-en/blob/master/065-tooooo/pwnbase.py) script. Our version is provided below:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import os
import sys
import socket

def recvuntil(sock, txt):
  d = ""
  while d.find(txt) == -1:
    try:
      dnow = sock.recv(1)
      if len(dnow) == 0:
        return ("DISCONNECTED", d)
    except socket.timeout:
      return ("TIMEOUT", d)
    except socket.error as msg:
      return ("ERROR", d)
    d += dnow
  return ("OK", d)

def recvall(sock, n):
  d = ""
  while len(d) != n:
    try:
      dnow = sock.recv(n - len(d))
      if len(dnow) == 0:
        return ("DISCONNECTED", d)
    except socket.timeout:
      return ("TIMEOUT", d)
    except socket.error as msg:
      return ("ERROR", d)
    d += dnow
  return ("OK", d)

# Proxy object for sockets.
class gsocket(object):
  def __init__(self, *p):
    self._sock = socket.socket(*p)

  def __getattr__(self, name):
    return getattr(self._sock, name)

  def recvall(self, n):
    err, ret = recvall(self._sock, n)
    if err != OK:
      return False
    return ret

  def recvuntil(self, txt):
    err, ret = recvuntil(self._sock, txt)
    if err != "OK":
      return False
    return ret

def go():
  global HOST
  global PORT

  # open socket
  s = gsocket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
  s.connect((HOST, PORT))

  recvuntil(s, "Size of shellcode? (MAX: 2000)\n")
  print("Size of shellcode? (MAX: 2000)")

  # open shellcode file
  with open("shellcode", "rb") as f:
    shellcode=bytes(f.read())

  # compute shellcode size
  num = str(len(shellcode))

  # send the shellcode size
  s.sendall(num + "\n")
  recvuntil(s, "Reading " + num + " bytes..")

  # send the shellcode
  s.sendall(shellcode)
  print(s.recvuntil("\n"))
  print(s.recvuntil("\n"))
  print(s.recvuntil("\n"))
  print(s.recvuntil("\n"))

  # close socket
  s.close()


HOST = '52.192.42.215'
PORT = 9427

go()

```

If we run the task we'll be able to get the flag.


```
Size of shellcode? (MAX: 2000)


Shellcode receieved. Launching Time Machine..

Perfect.

hitcon{whats happened happened, this is the mechanism of the world}
```

That's it, the solution to the tenet task.
